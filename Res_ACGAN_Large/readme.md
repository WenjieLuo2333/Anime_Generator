While Res_ACGAN without label fail to generate clear images.<br>
We still modified it into an conditional version to verify whether it's controllable or not.<br>
It seems that although image is not clear, but the way acgan works to control the output can make a difference.<br>
The result shows that the image at the same location generally has a same color of hair. It shows that ACGAN works to control the output.<br>

However, works to be done to make the image clear.
